Progress as of 3/8/2020. 
<br>
<i>Improvements:</i> Workable BFS/DFS search function (altered by .popleft() or .pop()) and returns correct paths. Both searches done in reasonable time (2-3 seconds for 3x3 puzzles). Implements global directory.<br>
<i>Problems:</i> Output paths do not match solutions. BFS returns shorter-than-expected paths while DFS returns (far-)longer-than-expected paths.
